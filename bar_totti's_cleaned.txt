{"author": "Anthony Jung", "text": "I called the wait on site, and they said it would take about 15 minutes, but they didn't call me even after 30 minutes. While waiting, I saw several empty tables and many people going in after waiting, so I wondered if there was something wrong with skipping our family. In the end, I gave up and got on the tram and while I was moving, I received a text message saying your table is ready, and I went back to Batoti. When I arrived again and showed them the text message, they told me to wait from the beginning again. Even after receiving the text message saying it was ready, I waited from the end of the waiting line again and barely managed to get a seat. Is this the system or is there really something going on?\nThe oven-baked bread was salty and delicious. I also ordered pasta, but it didn't come out even after an hour, probably because they forgot. I called them and asked, and they said sorry. I asked if I could cancel, and they said yes, so I cancelled and left.\nThe food was delicious, but considering the system? and racism?, it's not a place I would recommend to people around me. However, if you're going to go, please empty your mind and take your time.\n\nWe put our name on the waiting list and were told it would be about a 15-minute wait. However, 30 minutes passed and we were still not called. We noticed several empty tables and saw many people being seated after waiting, which made us wonder if our family was being skipped for some reason. Frustrated, we decided to leave and take a tram. While on the tram, we received a text message saying ‚Äòyour table is ready,‚Äô so we returned to Bar Totti. Upon showing the message to the staff, they told us we had to start waiting again from the beginning. We were eventually seated after rejoining the end of the waiting line.\nWe're left wondering if this is their standard operating procedure or if there was something else going on.\nThe wood-fired bread was salty and delicious. We also ordered pasta, but it never arrived. After an hour, we inquired about it and were simply told 'sorry.' We asked if we could cancel the order, and they agreed. So we canceled pasta and left.\nWhile the food was tasty, the system and potential discrimination made this an experience we wouldn't recommend to others.

{"author": "JUNG J", "text": "I went there during late lunch time without a reservation. It was raining, but only the terrace was available, and they told me not to wait in front, so I just sat on the terrace. (1st unpleasant experience) The server in charge was the man in the photo, and he didn't take our order or bring us water because he was chatting with a customer at the next table. He was rude when he took our order, and when we ordered beer and tap water, he didn't give us tap water until the beer and food arrived. (2nd unpleasant experience) It wasn't because he was busy, but he was chatting with the customers at the next table and showing them his SNS for an hour while we ordered, other people served our food, and we finished eating and paying. He didn't care about any Asian customers sitting at the outdoor table, including us. It was the worst service I've ever had during my entire trip to Australia. The food was average and the price was expensive. Except for that man (named justin), the staff who served and paid for our food were friendly. I think the racism is really bad and needs to be improved. Especially that person. But for those who really want to go, make a reservation and go.
